MultiTimer is a library for Arduino that allows you to have several functions to be called by the interrupt system on differing intervals.

It uses the ATmega's Timer2 to get interrupted.

Currently MultiTimer is in version 1.0 which is a fully working version. Improvements will be available in version 2. Interface will change in version 2, so upgrading to 2 will have some implications.

When time comes I'll write about it on my [homepage](http://www.midity.com).
